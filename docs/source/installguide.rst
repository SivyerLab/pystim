Install walkthrough
===================

The following instructions are for Windows machines. The instructions are mostly similar for OSX/Linux. If you run into
a problem with installing wxPython, please see the wxPython `website <https://www.wxpython.org/>`_ for help.

Installing PyStim
*****************
The following walkthrough uses Anaconda, an all in one Python environment manager. Unless otherwise noted, leave options
during install as defaults.

Enter lines of code in the terminal/command line. To open the command prompt, hit Windows + r, and type "cmd".


**NOTE:** to paste text copied from this guide into the terminal command: use mouse right click and paste. Ctrl + v will
not work.

#. Install `Miniconda`_. Two important options during install must be adhered to: Check the option to add conda to
   your PATH environment variable, and select the option to install conda only for the local user, NOT all users.

#. Install `Git`_ (version control tool). Make sure to select the option to add git to your PATH variable
   ("Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software").

#. Navigate to where you want to install the pyStim repository (ex: C:/Users/sivyer/stimulus_software): ::

    cd "C:/Users/sivyer/stimulus_software"

#. Download the repository (a new folder called pystim will be automatically created): ::

    git clone https://github.com/SivyerLab/pystim.git

#. Create a conda environment: ::

    conda create -y -n pystim python=3.8
    
#. Activate the environment. You should see `(pystim)` prepend lines on the command prompt after this: ::

    activate pystim

#. Install all the necessary packages: ::

    pip install psychopy sortedcontainers

#. (OPTIONAL) If you wish to be able to save captures of your stims, install `ffmpeg`_.

#. (OPTIONAL) If you wish to be able to playback movies, install `avbin`_.

#. (OPTIONAL) If needing to trigger an external device using a labjack install the labjack "UD driver" from the
   `labjack website`_. Then install the labjack package: ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython.git

#. (OPTIONAL) If you wish to interface with a TI Lightcrafter 4500, install `pycrafter4500`_: ::

    pip install pycrafter4500
    
#. Navigate to pystim. ::

    cd pystim

#. Run the pyStim GUI. ::

    python pyStim/pyStimGUI.py
